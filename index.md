I am a post doctoral researcher at the [Department of Economics and Business, University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it/unica/en/dip_scienzeecoaziend.page), and previously received my PhD from [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](http://economics.uc3m.es/) in 2021.

For the 2022 autumn term I will be visiting the [Centre for Macroeconomics at the London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/CFM).

My main area of research is macroeconomics and labour economics. In particular, I am interested in family, demography, and quantitative macroeconomics.

<div ID="abstractjmp" STYLE="display:none"><p>Many developed countries are at risk of experiencing population decline due to low fertility rates, with potential adverse economic effects. As a response, governments are deploying family policies to increase the number of children. In this paper, we propose a dynamic life-cycle model of fertility and female labour force participation to assess their effectiveness. We use the short-run fertility effects of a cash transfer policy from Spain to calibrate its parameters. Using the calibrated model, we find that the impacts in the long run are half as large as in the short run. This is driven by differences in the responses of younger and older women at the time of implementation. The latter must react shortly after, as they cannot delay fertility much longer. The former anticipate their first birth. This generates additional births in the short run. We also study the effects of an alternative policy consisting of childcare subsidisation, and explore how the coexistence of temporary and permanent contracts in Spain, which have different earnings profiles, affects fertility and interacts with cash transfers, by raising the costs of career interruptions in crucial child-bearing years.</p></div>

**The Sex Ratio, Marriage and Bargaining: A Look at China**\

<div ID="abstract1" STYLE="display:none"><p>I study married people's time allocation decisions under an unbalanced sex ratio, to answer whether bargaining between spouses should be accounted for (e.g. the collective model of the household) or not (unitary model). I document a substantial increase in the leisure ratio between married women and men in China from 1990 to 2010, calibrate a model of marriage, bargaining and marital sorting to the baseline year, and compare the predictions of a collective and unitary versions in 2010. In the former the leisure ratio does increase, but not in the latter. Via a decomposition exercise I find that the sex ratio accounts for about four hours of extra leisure per week for married women, driven by a decrease in paid work. The effect on married men is of the same magnitude and opposite sign. My results suggest that accounting for bargaining seems to be crucial to explain the sex-specific impact of changes that affect differently men and women.</p></div>

**[Quantifying the Impact of Childcare Subsidies on Social Security](Papers/Quantifying the Impact of Childcare Subsidies on Social Security.pdf)** with [Lidia Cruces](https://sites.google.com/view/lidiacruces/home?authuser=0)
<span class="brsmall"></span> 
<button class="abstract_button" onclick="ShowAndHide('abstract2')"><span class="text">Abstract</span></button>

<div ID="abstract2" STYLE="display:none"><p>Female labour force participation and fertility levels directly impact social security, especially when it relies on a pay-as-you-go scheme. In this paper, we quantify the impact of childcare subsidisation policies on a PAYG social security system. We build an overlapping generations model in which women decide how many children to have, the allocation of childcare time among different alternatives, and their labour force par-ticipation along the life cycle. We calibrate the model to Spanish data and use it to experiment with different childcare subsidisation policies. We find that childcare subsidies increase mother’s labour force participation and fertility minimally. Therefore, they have a negative effect on the present value of social security budget balance.</p></div>

<div ID="abstract1" STYLE="display:none"><p>Abstract Why agents consume more services relative to goods as income grows? We present a new theory of structural change which assumes that a representative household satisfies her final needs by means of home-production functions that use as inputs time and either goods or services purchased in the market. The relative purchase of goods and services thus depends, in addition to market prices, on the time requirement needed by each type of home production to satisfy the corresponding need. We calibrate the model to U.S. time series data and find that it can quantitatively account for structural transformation between goods and services, via both increasing relative price and quantity. Roughly half of structural change is accounted for by the fact that over time, the home activity employing services allows for a larger time saving with respect to the home activity employing goods. In addition, even if preferences are homothetic, the calibrated model generates an endogenous income effect, which makes a richer consumer display a larger consumption share of services, as observed in cross-sectional U.S. consumption data. This effect accounts for most of the remaining structural change generated by the model.</p></div>
