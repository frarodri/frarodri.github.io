## Hello,

I am a post doctoral researcher at the [Department of Economics and Business, University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it/unica/en/dip_scienzeecoaziend.page).
Currently visiting the [Centre for Macroeconomics at the London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/CFM) for the 2022 autumn term.

My research interests include Family Economics, Labor and Demographic Economics and Quantitative Macroeconomics.

## Working papers

**[The Sex Ratio, Marriage and Bargaining: A Look at China](Papers/The Sex Ratio, Marriage and Bargaining A Look at China.pdf)**\
(R&R - Review of Economic Dynamics)

I study married people's time allocation decisions under an unbalanced sex ratio, to answer whether bargaining between spouses should be accounted for (e.g. the collective model of the household) or not (unitary model). I document a substantial increase in the leisure ratio between married women and men in China from 1990 to 2010, calibrate a model of marriage, bargaining and marital sorting to the baseline year, and compare the predictions of a collective and unitary versions in 2010. In the former the leisure ratio does increase, but not in the latter. Via a decomposition exercise I find that the sex ratio accounts for about four hours of extra leisure per week for married women, driven by a decrease in paid work. The effect on married men is of the same magnitude and opposite sign. My results suggest that accounting for bargaining seems to be crucial to explain the sex-specific impact of changes that affect differently men and women. 

**[Quantifying the Impact of Childcare Subsidies on Social Security](Papers/Quantifying the Impact of Childcare Subsidies on Social Security.pdf)** with [Lidia Cruces](http://economics.uc3m.es/personal/lidia-cruces/)

Female labour force participation and fertility levels directly impact social security, especially when it relies on a pay-as-you-go scheme. In this paper, we quantify the impact of childcare subsidisation policies on a PAYG social security system. We build an overlapping generations model in which women decide how many children to have, the allocation of childcare time among different alternatives, and their labour force par-ticipation along the life cycle. We calibrate the model to Spanish data and use it to experiment with different childcare subsidisation policies. We find that childcare subsidies increase motherâ€™s labour force participation and fertility minimally. Therefore, they have a negative effect on the present value of social security budget balance.

**Child subsidies, female labour force participation and fertility: from short to long-run** with [Lidia Cruces](http://economics.uc3m.es/personal/lidia-cruces/)

What are the long-run effects of cash transfers to families with children on fertility and female labour force participation? In this paper, we answer this question with a life-cycle model in which women choose their labour supply, number of children, timing of the births and paid childcare usage. To calibrate the model's parameters, we take advantage of a natural experiment involving a universal cash transfer upon birth given by the Spanish government between 2007 and 2010. The short-term impact of this policy was assessed by [Gonzalez (2013)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.5.3.160). We match her findings on the effect of the policy on the number of births and mothers' labour force participation the year after the policy was enacted. Then, we use the model to determine the long-term impacts, break down the effect on fertility into tempo (changes in timing) and quantum effects (changes in the total number of children), and experiment with policy variations such as means-testing.

**A Theory of Structural Change, Home Production and Leisure** with Fenicia Cossu, [Alessio Moro](http://www.alessiomoro.it/) and [Silvio Tunis](https://sites.google.com/view/silviotunis/home-page)

Theories of structural change typically rely on non-homothetic components into preference to account for the contemporaneous rise of the relative price and the relative quantity of services observed in the data. We present a new theory of structural change which assumes homothetic preferences defined over two types of final consumption, each type satisfied by the household through the use of time and some amount of either manufacturing goods or services purchased in the market. The type of consumption produced using services displays a faster rate of time-saving technological change. As a result, even if services become more expensive than manufacturing in the market, the relative demand of services to manufacturing increases over time. We calibrate the model and find that it can quantitatively account for the rise in the share of services, via both increasing relative price and quantities. This pattern is driven by higher productivity growth in the home production employing services, which is about eight percentage points higher than that in the home production using goods
