## Working papers

**[Quantifying the Impact of Childcare Subsidies on Social Security](Papers/Quantifying the Impact of Childcare Subsidies on Social Security.pdf)** with [Lidia Cruces](http://economics.uc3m.es/personal/lidia-cruces/)

Female labour force participation and fertility levels directly impact social security, especially when it relies on a pay-as-you-go scheme. In this paper, we quantify the impact of childcare subsidisation policies on a PAYG social security system. We build an overlapping generations model in which women decide how many children to have, the allocation of childcare time among different alternatives, and their labour force par-ticipation along the life cycle. We calibrate the model to Spanish data and use it to experiment with different childcare subsidisation policies. We find that childcare subsidies increase motherâ€™s labour force participation and fertility minimally. Therefore, they have a negative effect on the present value of social security budget balance.

**[The Sex Ratio, Marriage and Bargaining: A Look at China](Papers/The Sex Ratio, Marriage and Bargaining A Look at China.pdf)**

I study married people's time allocation decisions under an unbalanced sex ratio, to tackle the question of whether bargaining between spouses should be accounted for (as in the collective model of the household) or not (as in the unitary model). I document time allocation patterns in China between 1990 and 2010 and find that the leisure ratio between married women and men increased substantially. I then calibrate a model of marriage, bargaining and marital sorting to the baseline year. I compare the predictions of a collective and unitary versions of the model in 2010, and find that the latter entirely misses the increase in the leisure ratio, while the former overshoots it. I decompose the results and find that the increase in the sex ratio accounts for about four hours of extra leisure per week for married women, driven by a decrease in paid work. The effect on married men is of the same magnitude and opposite sign.

**A Theory of Structural Change, Home Production and Leisure** with Fenicia Cossu, [Alessio Moro](http://www.alessiomoro.it/) and [Silvio Tunis](https://sites.google.com/view/silviotunis/home-page)

Theories of structural change typically rely on non-homothetic components into preference to account for the contemporaneous rise of the relative price and the relative quantity of services observed in the data. We present a new theory of structural change which assumes homothetic preferences defined over two types of final consumption, each type satisfied by the household through the use of time and some amount of either manufacturing goods or services purchased in the market. The type of consumption produced using services displays a faster rate of time-saving technological change. As a result, even if services become more expensive than manufacturing in the market, the relative demand of services to manufacturing increases over time. We calibrate the model and find that it can quantitatively account for the rise in the share of services, via both increasing relative price and quantities. This pattern is driven by higher productivity growth in the home production employing services, which is about eight percentage points higher than that in the home production using goods
