## Working papers

**[The Sex Ratio, Marriage and Bargaining: A Look at China](https://github.com/frarodri/Sex_ratio_marriage_bargaining_China/blob/main/Paper/The%20Sex%20Ratio%2C%20Marriage%20and%20Bargaining%20A%20Look%20at%20China.pdf?raw=true)**

This paper quantifes the importance of changes in the sex ratio on married couples' paid work, housework, leisure and marital sorting on education. To do so, I develop a model of marriage, bargaining and time allocation, and calibrate it to data for China, a country that has experienced a surge in boy births relative to girls' since the 1980s. I perform a decomposition exercise and find that the change in the sex ratio explains up to one half of the decrease in married women's paid work and half of the increase in their leisure time between 1990 and 2010, as well as one fifth of the increase in assortative mating. Moreover, in the model the changes in the sex ratio affect time allocation mainly through bargaining within the household and very marginally via marital sorting.

**[Quantifying the Impact of Childcare Subsidies on Social Security](Papers/Quantifying the Impact of Childcare Subsidies on Social Security.pdf)** with [Lidia Cruces](http://economics.uc3m.es/personal/lidia-cruces/)

Female labour force participation and fertility levels directly impact social security,especially  when  it  relies  on  a  pay-as-you-go  scheme.   In  this  paper,  we  quantify  theimpact of childcare subsidisation policies on a PAYG social security system.  We buildan overlapping generations model in which women decide how many children to have,the allocation of childcare time among different alternatives and their labour force par-ticipation along their life cycle.  We calibrate the model to Spanish data and use it toexperiment with different childcare subsidisation policies.  We find that childcare sub-sidies increase motherâ€™s labour force participation and fertility minimally.  Therefore,they have a negative effect on the present value of social security budget balance.
