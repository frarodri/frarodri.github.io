## Working papers

**[The Sex Ratio, Marriage and Bargaining: A Look at China](https://github.com/frarodri/Sex_ratio_marriage_bargaining_China/blob/main/Paper/The%20Sex%20Ratio%2C%20Marriage%20and%20Bargaining%20A%20Look%20at%20China.pdf?raw=true)**

This paper quantifes the importance of changes in the sex ratio on married couples' paid work, housework, leisure and marital sorting on education. To do so, I develop a model of marriage, bargaining and time allocation, and calibrate it to data for China, a country that has experienced a surge in boy births relative to girls' since the 1980s. I perform a decomposition exercise and find that the change in the sex ratio explains up to one half of the decrease in married women's paid work and half of the increase in their leisure time between 1990 and 2010, as well as one fifth of the increase in assortative mating. Moreover, in the model the changes in the sex ratio affect time allocation mainly through bargaining within the household and very marginally via marital sorting.

## Work in progress

**Childcare Subsidies and Pensions** with Lidia Cruces

Is it possible to simultaneously increase female labor force participation and fertility? In this paper we consider the policy with most promising empirical support: childcare subsidies. We build an overlapping generations model in which women choose fertility and labor force participation along their life cycle to assess the impact of these subsidies on pension finance sustainability.

*Draft coming very soon.*
