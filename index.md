I am a post doctoral researcher at the [Department of Economics, Universitat de Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/school-economics/), a junior researcher with the [Frankfurt Quantitative Macro Group at Goethe University](https://fqmg.de/) and a member of the [Barcelona Economic Analysis Team (BEAT)](https://www.ub.edu/beat/portfolio/fjrodriguezroman/). Previously I received my PhD from [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](http://economics.uc3m.es/) in 2021.

My main area of research is macroeconomics and labour economics. In particular, I am interested in family, demography, and quantitative macroeconomics.

**The Sex Ratio, Marriage and Bargaining: A Look at China**

<div ID="abstract1" STYLE="display:none"><p>I study married people's time allocation decisions under an unbalanced sex ratio, to answer whether bargaining between spouses should be accounted for (e.g. the collective model of the household) or not (unitary model). I document a substantial increase in the leisure ratio between married women and men in China from 1990 to 2010, calibrate a model of marriage, bargaining and marital sorting to the baseline year, and compare the predictions of a collective and unitary versions in 2010. In the former the leisure ratio does increase, but not in the latter. Via a decomposition exercise I find that the sex ratio accounts for about four hours of extra leisure per week for married women, driven by a decrease in paid work. The effect on married men is of the same magnitude and opposite sign. My results suggest that accounting for bargaining seems to be crucial to explain the sex-specific impact of changes that affect differently men and women.</p></div>

**Financial Incentives to Fertility: From Short to Long Run** with [Lidia Cruces](https://sites.google.com/view/lidiacruces/home?authuser=0)\

<div ID="abstractjmp" STYLE="display:none"><p>In this paper, we integrate available empirical evidence on the short-term effects of financial incentives to fertility with a dynamic life-cycle model featuring labor force participation and birth decisions to simulate long-term effects. We first discuss, in a simple model, why these can differ: while short-run effects arise from fertility decision adjustments by women of different ages during incentive implementation, long-run effects depend on women's responses with access to incentives throughout their fertile years. Then, we extend the model to a comprehensive life-cycle framework that captures the intricate trade-offs between career and family choices, and calibrate the parameters to match the short-run responses from a real policy in Spain. We find that the magnitude of the long-run effects is half that of the short-run effects (3% vs. 6%).</p></div>

<div ID="abstract2" STYLE="display:none"><p>Why do agents consume more services relative to goods as income grows? We present a theory of structural change assuming that a representative household satisfies final needs by means of two home-production functions in time and either goods or services from the market. When calibrating the model to U.S. data, roughly half of structural change is accounted for by technological change allowing services to display a larger time saving than goods in satisfying final needs. Also, even if preferences are homothetic, the calibrated model generates endogenous income effects, which account for the remaining structural change generated by the model.</p></div>

**[Quantifying the Impact of Childcare Subsidies on Social Security](Papers/Quantifying the Impact of Childcare Subsidies on Social Security.pdf)** with [Lidia Cruces](https://sites.google.com/view/lidiacruces/home?authuser=0)
<span class="brsmall"></span> 
<button class="abstract_button" onclick="ShowAndHide('abstract2')"><span class="text">Abstract</span></button>

<div ID="abstract2" STYLE="display:none"><p>Female labour force participation and fertility levels directly impact social security, especially when it relies on a pay-as-you-go scheme. In this paper, we quantify the impact of childcare subsidisation policies on a PAYG social security system. We build an overlapping generations model in which women decide how many children to have, the allocation of childcare time among different alternatives, and their labour force par-ticipation along the life cycle. We calibrate the model to Spanish data and use it to experiment with different childcare subsidisation policies. We find that childcare subsidies increase mother’s labour force participation and fertility minimally. Therefore, they have a negative effect on the present value of social security budget balance.</p></div>

**Slums and urbanisation without structural transformation** with [Alessio Moro](http://www.alessiomoro.it/)\
*This project is being funded with a [Small Research Grant](https://steg.cepr.org/funding/small-phd-research-grants-srgs) from the [Structural Transformation and Economic Growth (STEG)](https://steg.cepr.org/) programme (£25000).*

<div ID="abstract3" STYLE="display:none"><p>Urban population growth has occurred without much structural transformation in Sub-Saharan Africa: shares of employment in agriculture remain high, even in cities. Moreover, informal settlements or slums have emerged and persisted over time in the growing metropoles. This project aims to link these features of low-income country urbanisation with a dynamic spatial growth model. The expansion of the modern manufacturing and services sectors depends on the relative strength of two forces: urban congestion in the city core amplified by the slums (which is the only location in which modern economic activities may take place), and agglomeration economies created by the growing city. This framework has the potential to allow us to quantify the optimal urbanisation rate for low-income countries, and contribute to answer the question of whether they are urbanising too fast or not fast enough. </p></div>
