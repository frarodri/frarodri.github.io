I am a post doctoral researcher at Goethe University Frankfurt, a junior researcher with the [Frankfurt Quantitative Macro Group](https://fqmg.de/) and a member of the [Barcelona Economic Analysis Team (BEAT)](https://www.ub.edu/beat/portfolio/fjrodriguezroman/). I received my PhD from [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](http://economics.uc3m.es/) in 2021.

My main area of research is macroeconomics and labour economics. In particular, I am interested in family, demography, and quantitative macroeconomics.

<div ID="abstractjmp" STYLE="display:none"><p>Are financial incentives effective in increasing fertility rates? Empirical evidence suggests they are, primarily in the short run (around implementation). Can such policies also increase the total number of children in the long run? We address this question by using a structural life-cycle model of fertility and labor supply, calibrated to replicate the short-run effects of a cash transfer paid at childbirth implemented in 2007 in Spain. The model incorporates labor market duality, a defining feature of Spanish labor markets that negatively impacts fertility. Our calibrated model replicates a 6% increase in fertility rates in the short run but only generates a 3% rise in completed fertility over women’s lifetimes—the long run. Eliminating labor market duality increases lifetime fertility by 6.62%, but the discrepancy between short- and long-run effects of the incentive persists. These results highlight the limited impact of financial incentives alone to sustain fertility gains.</p></div>

<div ID="abstract1" STYLE="display:none"><p>We study marriage and time allocation decisions in the context of an increase in the sex ratio, as observed in China between 1990 and 2010. First, we document a rise in the leisure time ratio between married women and men during this period. Then we develop a model of marriage and time allocation decisions, and compare the predictive power of unitary (no bargaining) and collective versions (Egalitarian and Nash bargaining). We find that the collective model with Nash bargaining provides the best fit in terms of time allocation. To isolate the effect of changes in the sex ratio from other factors such as rising wages and increasing wage inequality, we perform a decomposition exercise. The rise in the sex ratio accounts for an additional hour and a half of weekly leisure for married women, with the opposite effect observed for men.</p></div>

<div ID="abstract2" STYLE="display:none"><p>Why do agents consume more services relative to goods as income grows? We present a theory of structural change assuming that a representative household satisfies final needs by means of two home-production functions in time and either goods or services from the market. When calibrating the model to U.S. data, roughly half of structural change is accounted for by technological change allowing services to display a larger time saving than goods in satisfying final needs. Also, even if preferences are homothetic, the calibrated model generates endogenous income effects, which account for the remaining structural change generated by the model.</p></div>

**[Quantifying the Impact of Childcare Subsidies on Social Security](Papers/Quantifying the Impact of Childcare Subsidies on Social Security.pdf)** with [Lidia Cruces](https://sites.google.com/view/lidiacruces/home?authuser=0)
<span class="brsmall"></span> 
<button class="abstract_button" onclick="ShowAndHide('abstract2')"><span class="text">Abstract</span></button>

<div ID="abstract2" STYLE="display:none"><p>Female labour force participation and fertility levels directly impact social security, especially when it relies on a pay-as-you-go scheme. In this paper, we quantify the impact of childcare subsidisation policies on a PAYG social security system. We build an overlapping generations model in which women decide how many children to have, the allocation of childcare time among different alternatives, and their labour force par-ticipation along the life cycle. We calibrate the model to Spanish data and use it to experiment with different childcare subsidisation policies. We find that childcare subsidies increase mother’s labour force participation and fertility minimally. Therefore, they have a negative effect on the present value of social security budget balance.</p></div>

**Urbanization, slums and growth** with [Alessio Moro](http://www.alessiomoro.it/)\
*This project is being funded with a [Small Research Grant](https://steg.cepr.org/funding/small-phd-research-grants-srgs) from the [Structural Transformation and Economic Growth (STEG)](https://steg.cepr.org/) programme (£25000)*

<div ID="abstract3" STYLE="display:none"><p>Urban population growth has occurred without much structural transformation in Sub-Saharan Africa: shares of employment in agriculture remain high, even in cities. Moreover, informal settlements or slums have emerged and persisted over time in the growing metropoles. This project aims to link these features of low-income country urbanisation with a dynamic spatial growth model. The expansion of the modern manufacturing and services sectors depends on the relative strength of two forces: urban congestion in the city core amplified by the slums (which is the only location in which modern economic activities may take place), and agglomeration economies created by the growing city. This framework has the potential to allow us to quantify the optimal urbanisation rate for low-income countries, and contribute to answer the question of whether they are urbanising too fast or not fast enough. </p></div>
