**[The Sex Ratio, Marriage and Bargaining: A Look at China](Papers/The Sex Ratio, Marriage and Bargaining A Look at China.pdf)**\

<p onclick="myFunction()"> Abstract </p>

<div id="myDIV">
I study married people's time allocation decisions under an unbalanced sex ratio, to answer whether bargaining between spouses should be accounted for (e.g. the collective model of the household) or not (unitary model). I document a substantial increase in the leisure ratio between married women and men in China from 1990 to 2010, calibrate a model of marriage, bargaining and marital sorting to the baseline year, and compare the predictions of a collective and unitary versions in 2010. In the former the leisure ratio does increase, but not in the latter. Via a decomposition exercise I find that the sex ratio accounts for about four hours of extra leisure per week for married women, driven by a decrease in paid work. The effect on married men is of the same magnitude and opposite sign. My results suggest that accounting for bargaining seems to be crucial to explain the sex-specific impact of changes that affect differently men and women.

**[Quantifying the Impact of Childcare Subsidies on Social Security](Papers/Quantifying the Impact of Childcare Subsidies on Social Security.pdf)** with [Lidia Cruces](https://sites.google.com/view/lidiacruces/home?authuser=0)

Female labour force participation and fertility levels directly impact social security, especially when it relies on a pay-as-you-go scheme. In this paper, we quantify the impact of childcare subsidisation policies on a PAYG social security system. We build an overlapping generations model in which women decide how many children to have, the allocation of childcare time among different alternatives, and their labour force par-ticipation along the life cycle. We calibrate the model to Spanish data and use it to experiment with different childcare subsidisation policies. We find that childcare subsidies increase motherâ€™s labour force participation and fertility minimally. Therefore, they have a negative effect on the present value of social security budget balance.
